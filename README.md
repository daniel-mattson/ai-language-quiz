# AI Language Quiz App

This app implements a simple language learning exercise — a series of multiple choice questions where the user must select the correct translation of a given word.
The twist here is that on the back-end, all the data for the questions is being generated by a Large Language Model — no human translators needed.

Before the quiz starts, the user can select the language they're trying to learn, and whether they want to generate new questions, or use the ones already saved.

To generate new questions, the user will need to provide their own Gemini API Key.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
